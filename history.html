                  <p><b>Non-Inventory Material Handler</b> (October 2019 to Present)<br>
                     As a Non-Inventory Material Handler I work with Non-Inventory Receivers and Procurement Operations Analysts to help maintain 
                     inventories and support operations. I support operations by maintaining the distribution of products throughout the fulfillment 
                     center and complete accurate daily counts of the Non-Inventory supplies. I maintain the in-process inventory from market to mini 
                     market and make sure the production areas are fully stocked with the necessary products. I escalate any low volume to managers to 
                     prevent the shortage of items as needed. Additionally, I assist in the management of pallets, Go-Carts, black pallet sleeves, and 
                     other various non-inventoried goods. I train new hires how to safely complete the job tasks. I am responsible for keeping the trailer 
                     board up to date and to do yard walks to evaluate any discrepancies within the board.

                     identified by management as a motivated worker and was introduced to many other aspects of the fulfillment process including supplying 
                     totes to pickers, deliver pallets of merchandise, packing boxes with customer orders, putting merchandise into the correct places,
                     and assisting associates as needed.
